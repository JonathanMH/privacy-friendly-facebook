This plugin allows the placement of Facebook Social Plugins in widget areas, load on interaction for protect their privacy and faster page load

== Description ==

This plugin allows the placement of [facebook social plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/) in widget areas, that load on user interaction to protect their privacy and speed up page load.

The purpose of lazy loading on user interaction has positive impact on the site performance, also it allows your users to benefit from facebook plugins, like liking your page, yet doesn't force them to let facebook know, that they are browsing your site.

An inspiration to this has been this plugin: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/09/03/0115241/heises-two-clicks-for-more-privacy-vs-facebook

Supported Facebook Social Plugins:

* [Like Button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/)
* [Like Box](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/)

Right now you can:

* define the facebook page url
* choose type of facebook social plugin to load
* define placeholder
* define height and width
* enable/disable: facepile, stream of posts
* define colours
* disable click to load

I plan to increase the functionality with:

* Interpretation of pasted codes, generated by facebooks own plugin generator

Only if they deliberately load the respective widget or you disable the feature for delaying the load until user interaction.
