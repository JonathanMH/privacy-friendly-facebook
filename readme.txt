This plugin allows the placement of [facebook social plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/) in widget areas, that load on user interaction to protect their privacy

== Description ==

The purpose of lazy loading on user interaction has positive impact on the site performance, also it allows your users to benefit from facebook plugins, like liking your page, yet doesn't force them to let facebook know, that they are browsing your site.

Right now you can:

* define the facebook page url

(WIP)
* define height and width
* enable/disable: facepile, stream of posts
* define colours
* choose type of facebook social plugin to load


I plan to increase the functionality with:

* Interpretation of pasted codes, generated by facebooks

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `fb_privacy_friendly_plugins` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` on your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to 'Appearance > Widgets' to place the Privacy Friendly Facebook Social Plugins Widget in one of your sidebar areas.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have multiple widgets active at the same time? =

Yes.

= Will facebook receive any data about my users? =

Only if they deliberately load the respective widget or you disable the feature for delaying the load until user interaction.


== Screenshots ==

1. This shows the widget in the backend and the options the user has.
2. This shows the output of the widget in the twenty eleven theme.

== Changelog ==
